# Homework: Fundamentals of Analysis and Algorithmic Strategies

This project contains the implementation of two algorithmic tasks.

---

### 1. Task 1: Min/Max Search

An implementation of a recursive search for the minimum and maximum elements in an array using the "Divide and Conquer" principle.

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` (due to the recursion stack)

---

### 2. Task 2: 3D Printer Queue Optimizer

A greedy algorithm for optimizing a 3D print queue. Jobs are sorted by priority, after which print batches are formed, taking into account the printer's constraints on volume and number of models. The execution time of a batch is determined by the longest job in it.

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` (due to sorting)
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
